üî• XOps Microchallenge #4 ‚Äì Infrastructure as Code + Configuration Management Combo! üî•
"Provision + Configure a Web App with Terraform & Ansible"
 
Dear Learners,
 
Now it‚Äôs time to introduce a core DevOps concept that ties infra + app + automation together ‚Äî but still simple enough to be achievable in a week. Please find below the interesting exercise.
 
Objective
Use Terraform to provision an AWS EC2 instance and then use Ansible to configure and deploy a simple web app on it (e.g., install NGINX, push HTML file, start service).
This challenge lets learners:
Reuse Terraform knowledge
Learn the basics of Ansible, a core DevOps config tool
Experience infra provisioning + software automation ‚Äî together!
 
Challenge Steps
1. Provision Infra using Terraform
Launch a t2.micro EC2 instance in us-east-1
Use appropriate key pair and security group for SSH and HTTP
Use user_data to install python3 (Ansible needs it)
2. Write Ansible Playbook
From your local machine, use Ansible to:
SSH into EC2 (use private key)
Install and start NGINX
Copy a custom index.html to /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
Ensure firewall (security group) allows access on port 80
3. Test Deployment
Hit the EC2 public IP in browser to confirm app is deployed
 
Expected Submission
‚úÖ GitHub Repo with:
main.tf ‚Äì Terraform infra
inventory ‚Äì Ansible host file
site.yml ‚Äì Ansible playbook
index.html ‚Äì Web content
README.md ‚Äì With clear setup instructions
Screenshot of:
EC2 instance
NGINX serving the custom page
Ansible run output
‚úÖ Share repo link in this post thread (only) with ‚úÖ
‚è∞ Timeline
Submission Deadline: Sunday, 27 July 2025
Time expected: ~2‚Äì3 hours over the week
‚ö†Ô∏è Cleanup Reminder
Run terraform destroy after verifying output
Terminate EC2 to avoid AWS charges
Learning Outcomes
